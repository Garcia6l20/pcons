"""Generator protocol for build file generation.

Generators take a configured Project and produce build system files
(e.g., Ninja, Makefiles, IDE project files). Generation is deferred:
``generate()`` enqueues work that runs via ``_generate_pending()``, which
``pcons`` calls right after it has run the build script.

Generation used to also run from an atexit hook, so that a script started as
``python pcons-build.py`` produced build files without asking. That put the
whole of configure — tool detection, compiler probes, dependency scanning —
inside an interpreter shutdown callback, where a worker pool cannot be started
and a library that registers a cleanup handler on import cannot even be
imported.
