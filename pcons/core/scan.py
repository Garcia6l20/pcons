"""Discovered dependencies: the Scanner primitive.

A :class:`Scanner` declares that the true dependencies — and possibly extra
outputs — of some build edges are a function of their inputs' *content*,
computed at build time. C++20 modules are the canonical case (``import m;``
orders compiles), Fortran modules another; a user's own pipeline qualifies
whenever one built artifact must embed or precede another based on what a
source file says.

The contract that keeps this correct with generated sources:

    Configure may depend only on static facts — file names, suffixes, flags,
    the target DAG. Content-derived facts flow through scan -> collate at
    build time.

Per scanned target, the resolver wires:

- one **scan edge** per governed build edge: its scanned sources in, one
  scan-info JSON file out (see :mod:`pcons.core.collate` for the schema).
  A generated source is simply the scan edge's input, so the producer's
  ordering is inherited from the node graph — no phases, no existence
  checks, any number of generation stages.
- one **collate edge** for the target: scan infos + a configure-written
  manifest + the exports of scanned dependency targets in; a ninja *dyndep*
  file, an exports file, and optional per-edge args files out.
- each governed edge gets ``dyndep = <target's dyndep file>`` plus an
  implicit dep on the collate edge.

Because the dyndep file is per *target*, ordering between scopes follows the
target DAG and the graph stays acyclic by construction; ninja connects
cross-scope artifact references through dyndep implicit outputs, which are
global to the build.

Only the ninja generator can express dyndep; other generators refuse a
scanned project with a clear error rather than emitting a wrong build.

    """A declared discovered-dependency scanner.

    Declare one, then :meth:`attach` it to targets before
    ``project.resolve()``. The resolver creates the scan and collate edges;
    the scanner itself is a value object and holds no project state.

    Attributes:
        name: Lowercase-hyphenated identifier (``"scene-refs"``); names the
            scan directory, rules, and error messages.
        source_suffixes: A governed edge is any build edge of an attached
            target with at least one source whose suffix is listed here;
            exactly those sources are scanned.
        scan_command: Command tokens for one scan edge. ``$SOURCE``/
            ``$SOURCES`` name the edge's scanned sources, ``$TARGET`` the
            scan-info file to write; ``$SRCDIR`` works as in
            ``env.Command``. Tokens may also be subst markers (e.g.
            :class:`~pcons.core.subst.NodeVar` for per-edge values supplied
            via ``scan_vars``). The command must write a scan-info JSON file
            (schema in :mod:`pcons.core.collate`). Scanners compare by
            value, so declare one and attach it everywhere — two inline
            declarations that differ only in a ``scan_vars`` lambda compare
            unequal (function identity) and are reported as conflicting.
        info_suffix: Appended to the governed edge's primary output path to
            name its scan-info file.
        scan_depfile: Optional depfile suffix (e.g. ``".d"``) the scan
            command writes, so edits to files the scan *read* re-run just
            that scan.
        scan_deps_style: ``"gcc"`` or ``"msvc"``; only used with
            ``scan_depfile``.
        scan_deps: Extra implicit deps of every scan edge — typically the
            scan tool script itself, as a project-relative path.
        scan_vars: Optional callable ``(env, scanned_sources, governed_node)
            -> dict[str, str]`` supplying per-edge ninja variables for the
            scan command, so edges with differing values still share one
            rule.
        collate_command: Override for the collate command tokens; ``None``
            uses the generic collate CLI (``python -m pcons.core.collate``).
            A custom command may reference ``NodeVar("SCAN_MANIFEST")`` —
            every collate edge carries its scope's manifest path under that
            variable, so all scopes still share one rule.
        manifest_extra: Optional callable ``(env, target) -> dict`` merged
            into the scope's manifest under ``"extra"`` — for a custom
            collate that needs facts beyond the neutral schema (a
            toolchain's BMI directory, say). JSON-serializable values only.
        edge_extra: Like ``manifest_extra``, per governed edge:
            ``(env, scanned_sources, governed_node) -> dict``, merged into
            that edge's manifest entry under ``"extra"``.
        provide_template: Artifact path for a provided logical name when the
            scan info gives none; ``{name}`` (sanitized), ``{scanner}`` and
            ``{scope}`` substitute.
        edge_args: Optional per-edge args file written by collate (see
            :class:`EdgeArgsSpec`).
        link_args: Optional per-*scope* args file for the target's final
            link edges — extra link inputs collate discovers (a standard
            library module's object, say). One file per scope, wired to the
            target's output edges: the file is an implicit dep (content
            changes re-link; the collate's restat keeps no-op rewrites
            quiet), the spec's var/token add the reference to the command.
        link_args_target_types: Apply ``link_args`` only to targets of
            these ``target_type`` strings (e.g. programs and shared
            libraries — an archiver takes no response file). Empty means
            all.
        on_unresolved: What the generic collate does with a require no scope
            provides: ``"ignore"`` (may be satisfied externally), ``"warn"``,
            or ``"error"``.
