    a toolchain can add its own with :func:`register_usage_requirement`.
    An unrecognized name raises rather than quietly becoming a list nothing

    The ``link_libs`` list is special: appending a ``Target`` creates a full

    headers, defines, transitive link libs — and links its output), while
    appending a ``str`` adds only a raw link token (``"m"`` → ``-lm``) with
    no usage requirements. The ``public`` scope re-exports to consumers;
    ``private`` does not. ``target.link(...)`` and ``target.link_private(...)``
    are the recommended high-level equivalents.

    A field may use a special list type (``UniqueList`` dedup, or
    ``ValidatedUniqueList`` whose ``on_append`` hook enforces invariants and

        A target is built first, and its public usage requirements

        target, like ``add_sources()``) is up to date first, without being

        Each build step of this target then holds the dependency's outputs
        (or the file) as tightly as it needs to. A step that records what it
        reads -- a compile with a depfile -- waits only for them to exist,
        and its own record says whether a change reruns it. A step that
        records nothing reruns whenever they change. So ``app.depends(
        "app.ld")`` relinks when the linker script changes and leaves the
        compiles alone, and ``lib.depends(gen)`` recompiles only the sources
        that included what ``gen`` wrote. What a library you ``link()``
        waits for reaches your compiles the same way, so a library whose
        public headers are generated declares the generator once.

        ``on_change`` overrides that choice for every step. ``True`` is for
        a file a step reads but cannot report -- a response file, a
        sanitizer ignore-list, an options file the tool never names in its
        depfile: the step reruns when it changes. ``False`` is for
