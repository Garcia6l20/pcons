    a toolchain can add its own with :func:`register_usage_requirement`.
    An unrecognized name raises rather than quietly becoming a list nothing

    The ``link_libs`` list is special: appending a ``Target`` creates a full
    dependency (the owner inherits that target's public usage requirements —
    headers, defines, transitive link libs — and links its output), while
    appending a ``str`` adds only a raw link token (``"m"`` → ``-lm``) with
    no usage requirements. The ``public`` scope re-exports to consumers;
    ``private`` does not. ``target.link(...)`` and ``target.link_private(...)``
    are the recommended high-level equivalents.

    A field may use a special list type (``UniqueList`` dedup, or
    ``ValidatedUniqueList`` whose ``on_append`` hook enforces invariants and
    invalidates caches). Whole-list assignment preserves those semantics:
