"""Build-time collation for pcons's Scanner (discovered dependencies) primitive.

A Scanner has two halves. The *scan* half is the user's own tool: for one
governed edge it reports what that edge provides, what it requires, and any
files it discovered along the way, as a small JSON document. The *collate*
half is generic and lives here: it gathers every scan-info document of one
scope, resolves each requirement to the artifact that provides it, and writes
the Ninja dyndep file (plus optional per-edge argument files) that reorders
the build accordingly.

Collate runs from the build directory as a ninja edge::

    python -m pcons.core.collate --manifest scan/scene-refs/pack_level1.manifest.json

Three JSON schemas connect the halves. All paths in them are relative to the
build directory, and all paths emitted use forward slashes.

**Scan info** (one per governed edge, written by the user's scan tool)::

    {"version": 1,
     "provides": [{"name": "engine.core", "path": "optional/path"}],
     "requires": ["engine.render"],
     "extra_deps": ["some/discovered/file"],
     "extra_outputs": ["some/dynamic/output"]}

Every field but ``version`` is optional. A provide with no ``path`` gets the
provide template applied.

A provide names *where* a logical name lives, so that requiring edges can
depend on it; ``extra_outputs`` names what the edge writes beyond its declared
outputs, and is the only thing that becomes a dyndep implicit output. Every
provide path must therefore be backed by one of the edge's declared outputs or
by one of its ``extra_outputs`` -- a dyndep output nothing writes would leave
ninja rebuilding that edge forever, so collate rejects it.

**Manifest** (written at configure time by pcons)::

    {"version": 1, "scanner": "scene-refs", "scope": "pack_level1",
     "dyndep": "scan/scene-refs/pack_level1.dyndep",
     "exports_out": "scan/scene-refs/pack_level1.exports.json",
     "imports": ["scan/scene-refs/pack_common.exports.json"],
     "provide_template": "packs/{name}.pack",
     "on_unresolved": "ignore",
     "edge_args": {"suffix": ".modmap", "var": "SCAN_ARGS",
                   "format": {"header": ["$root ."], "line": "{name} {path}"},
                   "include": "requires+provides"},
     "edges": [{"out": "packs/level1.pack",
                "declared_outputs": ["packs/level1.pack"],
                "info": "packs/level1.pack.scaninfo.json",
                "args_file": "packs/level1.pack.modmap",
                "provide_template": null}]}

A per-edge ``provide_template`` overrides the scanner-level one when non-null.
``edge_args`` may be null or absent, meaning no argument files.

**Exports** (written here, imported by dependent scopes)::

    {"version": 1, "scanner": "scene-refs", "scope": "pack_level1",
     "provides": {"level1": "packs/level1.pack"}}

Unknown keys are ignored everywhere, so a schema can grow without breaking
older collators.
