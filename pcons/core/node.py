"""Node hierarchy for the pcons dependency graph.

Nodes are the fundamental unit in the dependency graph. Each node represents
something that can be a dependency or a target in the build system.

Node types:
    - FileNode: A file (source or generated)
    - DirNode: A directory with special semantics for targets vs sources
    - ValueNode: A computed value (e.g., config hash, version string)
    - AliasNode: A named group of targets (phony target)

    A Node represents something that can be a dependency or target.
    Nodes track their dependencies (both explicit and implicit) and
    where they were defined for debugging.

    The two dependency lists use Ninja's terminology, and generators render
    them that way:

    - ``explicit_deps`` are the edge's *positional inputs*. They land in
      ``$in``, so the command sees them. Builders put the thing being
      compiled/linked/copied here (mirroring ``_build_info["sources"]``);
      add them with :meth:`add_inputs`.
    - ``implicit_deps`` must be up to date before the edge runs but are NOT
      on the command line (Ninja's ``| dep`` syntax). Scanner and depfile
      results live here, and so does everything :meth:`depends` adds.
    - ``order_only_deps`` must merely *exist* before the edge runs (Ninja's
      ``|| dep`` syntax). Changing one does not make the edge dirty. This is
      for a file that might or might not be consumed, where a depfile decides
      after the fact — see :meth:`order_after`.

    Attributes:
        explicit_deps: Positional inputs; visible to the command as ``$in``.
