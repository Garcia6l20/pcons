    Answers ``get_child_nodes()``/``has_child_nodes()`` without scanning the

    projects (one bundle per plugin, say) make that call once per install
    target and spend all their generate time there.

    Two paths keep it honest:

    * ``Project.node()``/``dir_node()`` *maintain* it as nodes are registered
      — O(path depth) each, and the only path a normal build takes.
    * :meth:`sync` *repairs* it. A build script may write ``Project._nodes``
      directly (``examples/15_custom_builder`` does), so a count mismatch
      means the index missed something and it is rebuilt wholesale. Rare, so
      the rebuild cost doesn't matter; the check itself is an int compare.

    Stores paths rather than Node objects, so replacing the node under an
    existing key can't leave a stale object behind — the caller resolves
    paths through ``_nodes`` at query time.

        Searches for the package using the configured finder chain
        (default: PkgConfigFinder → SystemFinder). Results are cached per
        environment, so repeated calls with the same arguments return the
        same target and two environments may hold two different answers for
        one package name.

        The returned target can be used as a dependency via target.link()
        or applied directly to an environment via env.use().

        Args:
            name: Package name (e.g., "zlib", "openssl").
            env: The environment the package is for. It selects the cache
                slot and becomes the returned target's environment, so a
                cross build and a host build each get their own. Without
                one, the environment a target with none of its own inherits
                is used, which in a single-environment project is that
                environment.
            version: Optional version requirement (e.g., ">=3.0").
            components: Optional list of package components.
            required: If True (default), raises PackageNotFoundError when
                     the package is not found. If False, returns None.
            system: If True, the package's include directories are treated as
                   system headers (-isystem, /external:I), so warnings from
                   its headers are suppressed in every dependent. Off by
                   default: -isystem on a directory the compiler already
                   searches (/usr/include) reorders the search and can break
                   the standard library. Use it for prefixes owned by a
                   package manager or a fetched source tree.

        Returns:
            An ImportedTarget representing the package, or None if not
            found and required=False.

        Raises:
            PackageNotFoundError: If the package is not found and required=True.
