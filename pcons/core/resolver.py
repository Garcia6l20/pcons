"""Target resolution system — tool-agnostic factory dispatch.

The Resolver turns high-level Target descriptions into concrete build nodes
in three phases:

1. **Main resolution** (resolve() -> _resolve_target()): for each target in
   dependency order, dispatch to its registered factory (via BuilderRegistry)
   to create build nodes. All tool-specific logic lives in the factories
   (CompileLinkFactory, InstallNodeFactory, ArchiveNodeFactory,
   CommandNodeFactory below).
2. **Pending source resolution** (resolve_pending_sources()): targets that
   reference other targets' outputs (Install, Tarfile, ...) store those
   sources as "pending" and resolve them here, after output_nodes exist.
3. **Command expansion** (_expand_node_commands()): expand each node's
   command template (env.<tool>.<command_var> plus ToolchainContext
   overrides) into node._build_info["command"].

Targets are just descriptions until resolve() is called, so output_name,
flags, etc. can be customized after target creation.
