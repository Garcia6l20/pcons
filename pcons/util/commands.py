"""Cross-platform command helpers for pcons build rules.

These helpers are designed to be invoked from ninja build rules using Python.
They handle forward slashes and spaces in paths correctly on all platforms.

Usage in build rules:

    python -m pcons.util.commands concat <src1> <src2> ... <dest>
    python -m pcons.util.commands copytree [--depfile FILE] [--stamp FILE] <src> <dest>
