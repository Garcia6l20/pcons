"""Building an Android package with androiddeployqt.

    from pcons.toolchains.qt.android import android_deployment_settings
    from pcons.toolchains.qt.apk import android_apk

    app = project.QtSharedLibrary("myapp", env, sources=[...])
    settings = android_deployment_settings(project, env, app=app)
    apk = android_apk(project, env, app=app, settings=settings)

A release package comes out unsigned and installs on nothing until
:func:`sign_apk` runs apksigner over it. **No keystore password is ever a
pcons argument**: the caller names an environment variable or a file and
apksigner reads the value when the edge runs, so nothing secret is written
into build.ninja.

androiddeployqt reads the application out of ``<output>/libs/<abi>/`` and
does not put it there. Its own dependency libraries it does copy, out of
the ``extraLibraryDirs`` the settings file names, but not the application
itself. Measured against Qt 6.11.1: with nothing staged it exits 0, reports
"Android package built successfully", and produces a package with no
application in it. Staging is what stands between a build and that.

A copy, rather than building the application straight into the staging
directory the way Qt's CMake does. One environment then builds any number
of applications, each with its own staging directory, instead of needing
one environment each because of a packaging detail.

**androiddeployqt drives Gradle**, which is a build system inside a build
edge, and pcons's first rule is configuration rather than execution. It is
still the right call: the alternative is owning Qt's Java, its manifest
merging and its resource pipeline. The cost is real and worth knowing. The
first run downloads the Gradle distribution and the Android Gradle plugin
from the network, which takes minutes; later runs use the cache. Measured
with a warm cache, Qt 6.11.1: 19 s for a debug package, 35 Gradle tasks.
No system Gradle is needed, androiddeployqt brings its own wrapper.
