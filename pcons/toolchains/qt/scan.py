"""Generate-time scan for Qt meta-object macros (automoc).

Finds ``Q_OBJECT``/``Q_GADGET``/``Q_NAMESPACE`` in a target's sources and
their project-local headers, deciding which moc edges to create. This is
the qmake model (scan at generation, not at build), made safe:

- moc's own depfiles keep every *existing* edge incrementally correct at
  build time — the scan only decides *which* edges exist.
- A per-target staleness guard (scan manifest, checked by a cheap build
  edge) turns "the scan result would change" into a loud, actionable
  build error instead of a mysterious vtable link failure.

Scanning reads file *contents* at configure/generate time (like any
configure check) and is cached by (path, mtime, size), so warm re-runs
do no I/O beyond stat calls.
