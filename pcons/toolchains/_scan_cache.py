"""Persist C++ module scan results, so an unchanged TU is not rescanned.

A p1689 scan is a full preprocessor run: ~40 ms per translation unit, and every
pcons invocation repeated all of them. GCC already tells us exactly what each
scan read, via the ``-MD -MF`` depfile the scanner asks for and used to discard.
That prerequisite list is the invalidation key: if none of those files changed,
last run's answer still stands.

Stamps are (mtime_ns, size), not content hashes. Hashing a TU's ~300
prerequisites would cost more than the scan it saves, and a false miss only
costs one scan.

Stored as its own JSON file rather than in :class:`pcons.core.cache.BuildCache`,
which is the store the CLI persists settings in and ``pcons cache show`` prints:
a megabyte of scan results per build directory does not belong in either. What
that store does own is the write discipline, which this one repeats -- JSON, and
a temp file replaced into place, so an interrupted write cannot leave a file that
the next run refuses to read.

    missing files into a permanent cache miss.

    A ``:`` separates a rule's target only when whitespace (or the end of the
