"""User-declared CLI commands, reachable as ``pcons run <name>``.

A build script, or an add-on module's ``register()``, declares a command with
`cli_command` and it becomes ``pcons run <name>``:

    import click
    import pcons

    @pcons.cli_command()
    @click.option("--baud", default=115200)
    def flash(baud: int) -> None:
        '''Flash the board.'''

The decorators return real click objects, so users write click directly.

One registry holds every declaration, keyed by name. Each entry records the
origin it came from, ``"script"`` or ``"module:<name>"``, and the module whose
body ran the decorator. Between them those say what a re-run of the build
script will re-declare, and so what is safe to drop on the way in: the script's
own body, and nothing else. An add-on module is loaded once per process; so is
a helper module the script imports, whose decorator therefore fires only on the
first run.
