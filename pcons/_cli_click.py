"""click building blocks for the pcons command line.

The pieces here replace three argparse workarounds:

- a subcommand no longer overwrites what was spelled before it, so
  ``pcons -B out generate`` generates into ``out``. See `MergingCommand`.
- ``pcons hello`` is a target to build, not an unknown command. See `PconsGroup`.
- ``-C DIR`` chdirs from an eager callback instead of a hand-written scan that
  edited ``sys.argv`` in place. See `directory_option`.

The option decorators exist so every command declares the option groups it opts
into, instead of two parsers repeating the same lists and drifting apart.
