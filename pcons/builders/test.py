"""Test builder: declare a test in the build description.

The Test builder produces a Target with ``target_type="test"`` whose
``_builder_data["spec"]`` holds a fully-resolved :class:`TestSpec` after
the resolver runs. The Ninja generator emits a ``test-build`` phony so
``ninja test-build`` compiles every program a test runs against, and a
``test`` phony that invokes ``pcons test``. The TestSpecs are also
serialized to ``<build_dir>/tests.json`` for the runner to consume.

A Test target has no output files of its own — it is purely declarative,
similar to ``InstallSymlink``. Its dependency on the program target is
what makes ``test-build`` work.

                the test target is named ``test_<name>``.
            program: The thing to run. A Target (typically from
                ``project.Program``), a path, or a string command name.
            args: Arguments passed after the program.
            cwd: Working directory for the test process. Defaults to the
                build directory.
            env: Extra environment variables for the test process.

                others (useful for tests that contend on shared
                resources like ports or GPUs).
            disabled: If True, the test is recorded but always skipped.
