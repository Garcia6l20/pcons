"""Compile/link builders for programs and libraries.

This module provides builders for compiled targets:
- Program: Create executable programs
- StaticLibrary: Create static libraries (.a, .lib)
- SharedLibrary: Create shared libraries (.so, .dylib, .dll)
- ObjectLibrary: Compile sources without linking
- HeaderOnlyLibrary: Interface library with no sources
- Command: Custom command builder
