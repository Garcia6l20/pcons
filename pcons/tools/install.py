    Each source tree's *contents* land directly in the destination, keeping
    their relative paths, so ``a/tree/x/y.txt`` and ``b/tree/x/z.txt`` both
    arrive under ``<dest>/x/``. The source directory's own name is not
    appended; that is what separates this from :class:`InstallDirBuilder`,
    whose callers rely on the name being appended.

    When two trees hold the same relative path, the later one in *sources*
    wins. Argument order is the only rule, so the call site shows the answer.

    One target owns the destination and emits one copy edge per surviving
    file, which is what makes the conflict expressible: two independent
    targets writing one file would be two producers, which pcons refuses.

    The destination is a staging directory in the build tree, anchored under
    *env*'s build directory, and the install prefix is never applied. This is
    file staging, not an install.

    Adding a file anywhere under a source tree makes it appear in the
    destination on the next build, with no hand-run of pcons: every directory
    in every source tree is registered as a configure dependency, so pcons
    re-runs before the build when one gains or loses an entry. The price is
    that any edit to those trees re-runs the build description.

    Removing a file from a source tree drops its copy edge, but the copy
    already in the destination stays: this stages files, it does not mirror,
    and deleting from a directory the builder does not own would be a wider
    promise than it makes. Delete the destination, or run
    ``ninja -t cleandead``, to clear stale copies.

    *exclude* drops entries from every source tree before they are merged.
    Patterns are globs matched against the path relative to *each source
    root*, never the destination and never an absolute path, because the
    roots are the only thing the caller named. A pattern holding no ``/``
    matches a name at any depth, one holding a ``/`` is anchored at the
    root, and matching is case sensitive everywhere. An excluded directory
    takes its contents with it. Nothing is excluded by default: a staging
    directory holds what the caller said it holds, and a silent filter is
    worse than a visible one.

        stage = project.OverlayDir(
