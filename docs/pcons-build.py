"""Build the pcons documentation site, with pcons.

The site is mkdocs-based (mkdocs.yml at the repo root); ReadTheDocs and
`make docs-site` invoke mkdocs themselves. This wraps the same build so
`pcons -C docs` produces it too, into docs/build/site/, and rebuilds only
when a page or the configuration changed.

The custom-tools pipeline that used to live here is now
examples/69_custom_tools_pipeline.
