"""One project, two environments, one library built for both.

Each environment owns a slice of the build directory, so the same library and
the same program can be declared once per environment without renaming
anything:

    build/host/lib/libchecksum.a    build/host/bin/app
    build/strict/lib/libchecksum.a  build/strict/bin/app

What it shows:

- `env.build_prefix`, holding everything an environment writes, object files
  included.
- `env.archive_directory` and `env.runtime_directory`, placing the artifacts by
  kind below it. The toolchain still decides "lib", ".a" and ".exe".
- Two targets sharing a name, told apart by their environments.
- `checksum@host`, the spelling that names one of them, read by
  `project.get_target`, by `project.Default` and by `pcons build`. A link
  string stays a raw link token, so the target is passed as an object and
  `link("m")` still means `-lm`.

Not the same as example 66_multi_project, which is two top-level projects with
two build directories and no edges between them, nor 34_multi_build_dir, which
builds one variant per pcons run. This is one build, described once, targeting
two environments at the same time.
