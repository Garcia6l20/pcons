"""Build script for libbar - a library nested two levels down.

Like libfoo, this builds either on its own or as part of a parent build.
Nothing here is written differently for the two cases: `project.root_dir`
and `project.build_dir` always refer to this directory and this library's
own build output, wherever it sits in a larger tree.
