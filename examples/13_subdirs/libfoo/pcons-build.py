"""Build script for libfoo - can be built standalone or as part of a parent.

This demonstrates a subdir that works both:
- Standalone: `cd libfoo && pcons`
- As subdir: called from parent pcons-build.py

It also pulls in its own subdirectory, so libbar ends up one level down when
libfoo is built directly and two levels down when the top-level project
builds everything. Neither script says anything about where it sits.
