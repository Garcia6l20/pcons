"""A generator that has to run from the source root.

Build tools run from the build directory, and pcons writes every path in a
command relative to it. That is wrong for the generator here, which looks up
its input at the fixed relative path ``data/items.txt`` -- a shape that turns
up in any project ported from a build system that ran from the top of the
tree.

``cwd=`` moves the command, and moves its paths with it: ``$SOURCE`` and
``$TARGET`` come out relative to the working directory the command asked for,
so nothing else in the rule has to change. Writing ``cd .. &&`` into the
command instead would look equivalent and quietly break the
``write_if_different`` wrapper, whose two halves have to run in the same
directory (they would then restore nothing, and every downstream target would
rebuild on every run).

Touching data/items.txt below re-runs the generator; because it writes the
same bytes, the .o and the program are not rebuilt. test.toml asserts that.
