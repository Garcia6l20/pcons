"""A C++20 module interface written by a program this build compiles.

Not just a generated source that *imports* a module (see
`71_cxx_modules_codegen`) -- here the `.cppm` that *exports* one is itself a
build product, and `app` imports it. That works with zero staging because
every decision pcons has to make at configure time is already available:

1. **The suffix is a static fact.** `gen/iface.cppm` doesn't exist when the
   build script runs, and pcons never asks the filesystem. It reads `.cppm`
   off the declared path, and that alone is enough to compile the file as a
   module interface and to enrol it in `genmod`'s scan scope.

2. **The scan waits for the generator.** The generated file is an ordinary
   input to the scan edge, so ninja orders the scan after the `COMMAND` edge
   that writes it. Nothing is scanned before it exists.

3. **The BMI is discovered, not declared.** Which module `iface.cppm` exports
   is decided by the program that writes it. The scan reports `gen`, the
   collate writes it into `genmod`'s dyndep file as an implicit output of that
   compile, and `app`'s modmap picks it up at build time -- so the flags that
   point the compiler at the BMI arrive without a reconfigure.
