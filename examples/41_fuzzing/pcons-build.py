"""Build script demonstrating fuzz testing via libFuzzer + Test().

Pcons doesn't have a dedicated "fuzz target" builder — fuzzing is just a
fuzzer-instrumented Program plus one or two Tests. The pattern below is
the same shape you'd use for AFL++ or Honggfuzz (see the Fuzzing section
of docs/user-guide.md for those recipes); only the build flags and the
campaign invocation change.

The harness:
- `src/parser.c`: a tiny `parse_keyvalue()` function (the code under test).
- `src/fuzz_parser.cpp`: the libFuzzer entrypoint `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
  (.cpp so pcons picks the C++ linker driver — libFuzzer is itself a
  C++ library and needs the C++ runtime.)
- `corpus/`: a few seed inputs replayed by the regression test.

Two tests are declared:
- `parser.regression` — replays the corpus. Fast (<1s).
  commit.
- `parser.campaign` — fuzzes for a few seconds. Labelled "fuzz" so
  `pcons test -LE fuzz` excludes it from fast inner loops.

libFuzzer is clang-only: this script requires the LLVM toolchain and
raises if clang isn't found. The flags are written out inline rather
than hidden behind a helper, so it's obvious what the binary is being
built with.
