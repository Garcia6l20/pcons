"""Commands of your own, reachable as `pcons run <name>`.

A build script describes what to build. Anything else a project needs done --
flash a board, publish a release, print where an artifact landed -- usually ends
up in a shell script beside it, with its own way of finding the build directory.
This declares those commands in the build script instead, so they see the
project pcons just described:

    pcons run                 list what is available
    pcons run greet --name x  run the program this build produced
    pcons run where           print where the artifacts are
    pcons run docs list       a group of related commands

A command runs after the script has been read and the project resolved, so it
can ask the project anything -- target names, output paths, the build
directory. It builds nothing unless it declares a dependency, which none here
does -- see `examples/68_command_dependencies` for that. So `greet` below has
to cope with a program that is not built yet.

The decorators return real click objects, so `click.option`, `click.argument`
and `click.Choice` are all available. click is part of pcons' public surface
here, deliberately: a translation layer would only be a smaller click.
