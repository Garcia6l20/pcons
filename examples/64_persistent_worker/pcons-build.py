"""Running an action in a persistent worker.

An action that costs more to start than to run is handed to a process that
has already started. See docs/worker-protocol.md for what a worker is and
what one must do; ``PythonWorker`` here is the kind pcons bundles.

``src/render.py`` prints whether it started with the parser already loaded,
which is how you can see a worker was used. It is not asserted: with no
worker reachable the action runs directly and must produce the same file,
which is why this example works the same on Windows, which has no fork.
