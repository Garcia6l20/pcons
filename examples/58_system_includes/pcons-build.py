"""System include directories: third-party headers, without their warnings.

Any project that vendors an SDK hits this. Your own code builds with
``-Wall -Wextra -Werror``; the SDK's headers were written to someone else's
standards and produce a flood of warnings you can neither fix nor ignore.

The answer everywhere is a second kind of include path — ``-isystem`` on
GCC/Clang, ``/external:I`` on MSVC, ``-imsvc`` on clang-cl — searched exactly
like ``-I`` but exempt from warnings. In pcons that's ``system_includes``,
alongside ``includes``, on any compile tool:

    env.cc.system_includes.append(sdk_dir)

and as a usage requirement, so a library can hand its consumers a vendored
SDK's headers without handing them its warnings:

    sdk.public.system_include_dirs.append(sdk_dir)

External packages take the same treatment through a ``system=`` argument,
which moves the package's include dirs to the system list without any list
surgery on the target::

    doctest = project.find_package("doctest", system=True)
    imported = ImportedTarget.from_package(description, system=True)
    env.use(description, system=True)

Both spellings are relativized in the generated build files, so build.ninja
stays relocatable.
