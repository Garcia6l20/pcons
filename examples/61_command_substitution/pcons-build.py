"""Substitutions that are part of an argument rather than all of it.

`59_codegen_sources` covers the shape of a code-generation rule -- a built
tool, declared source order, `${SOURCES[1:]}`. This one is about the spelling
of the arguments, where each marker sits inside a larger word:

- `./${SOURCES[0]}` -- how you run a program this build produced. A POSIX
  shell resolves a bare name on `$PATH` and will not find something sitting
  in the build directory; `cmd.exe` searches the current directory instead,
  and has no `./`, hence the platform check below.
- `--out=$TARGET` -- a flag welded to the path it names.
- `-i${SOURCES[1:]}` -- attached to a form that expands to *several* paths,
  so it repeats: `-ione.txt -ithree.txt -itwo.txt`, not one `-i` on the
  first. bundler.c rejects a bare argument, so a wrong expansion fails the
  build instead of quietly bundling the wrong thing.
- `$$Revision$$` -- `$$` is one literal dollar, handed to the program
  untouched by ninja, make, and the shell. It is not a shell variable
  reference: build scripts are Python, so read the environment there, with
  os.environ, where pcons can see the value and record it.
