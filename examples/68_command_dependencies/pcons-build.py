"""Commands that build what they need first.

`pcons run <name>` builds nothing by default: a command gets a resolved
project, not a built one. A command that needs an artifact says so, and pcons
builds it first:

    publish.depends(report)

    pcons run publish     generates the build files, builds report, then runs

That is the whole feature. `depends` takes targets, the ones this build script
already declared, and takes nothing else -- no names, no paths.

Declaring it is the opt-in. `inspect` below declares nothing and behaves as it
always has: no build files written, no build started, and it has to cope with
an artifact that may not exist yet.
