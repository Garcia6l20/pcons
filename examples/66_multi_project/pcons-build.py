"""Two independent projects in one build script.

A firmware-style split: the same source tree built two ways, each as its
own top-level project with its own build directory and build.ninja. One
`pcons` run generates and builds both, in script order.

The first project keeps the default build directory (so `-B` works); each
later sibling names its own. Both embed the same `common/` subdirectory,
compiled per project with that project's flags.

Run `pcons`, then `./build/app` and `./build-host/app`.
