"""Nested projects metadata example.

Three levels of nested Project() instances, each created via
add_subdirectory:

    nested_root              (this file)
    +-- nested_child         (child/pcons-build.py)
        +-- nested_grandchild (child/grandchild/pcons-build.py)

Every level creates its OWN Project and defines one Program. This exercises
the IDE metadata generator (pcons_metadata.json): each project must get its
own entry, and each entry must list only its own targets - no target may
appear under an ancestor project.

Validated by test_metadata.py via the example test runner.
