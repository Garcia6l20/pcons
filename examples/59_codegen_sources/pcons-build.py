"""A generator this build compiles, run over however many inputs there are.

This is the normal shape of a code-generation rule: one `source=` list holding
*a tool the build just built* followed by *a variable number of data files*.
Two things have to hold for it to work, and both are easy to get wrong:

1. **Declared order is preserved.** `${SOURCES[0]}` is the tool because the
   tool was written first — not whichever input happened to be a plain path.
   A Target source holds its place in the list just as a path does.

2. **Slices.** The number of `.def` files is a property of the project, not of
   this rule, so the command says "the rest of them" rather than listing
   indices: `${SOURCES[1:]}`. Adding a file to `defs` changes nothing here.

3. **The tool is named with a directory.** `${SOURCES[0]}` expands to
   `collate`, and a POSIX shell reads a bare name as something to look up on
   `$PATH` — where a program in the build directory is not. Hence the `./`
   (see `61_command_substitution`; `cmd.exe` searches the current directory
   instead and has no `./`, so on Windows the prefix is empty).

Any `${...}` pcons doesn't recognize is an error rather than a literal passed
through to the build tool.
