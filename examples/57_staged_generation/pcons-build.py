"""Staged generation: the build discovers what to build, mid-build.

The plugin set here is data that only a *compiled program* can produce, so it
isn't known when the build description first runs. Real projects hit this
whenever a definition language, an IDL, or a schema decides the target list.

pcons describes the graph up front and never creates targets during the build,
so it stages instead:

  pass 1  describe what produces the manifest (compile list-plugins, run it)
          ↓  ninja builds those, then re-runs pcons because build.ninja
             declares the manifest as one of its own inputs
  pass 2  the manifest exists, so ``when_generated`` fires and the per-plugin
          targets join the graph; ninja reloads and builds them

All of it happens inside one ``ninja`` invocation, from a clean tree.

Two pieces make it work:
  * the self-regeneration edge every generated build file now carries, whose
    inputs include anything the build script read (``generated_input`` /
    ``add_configure_dependency``);
  * ``write_if_different=True``, so a generator that rewrites all its outputs
    every run doesn't invalidate everything downstream of them.
