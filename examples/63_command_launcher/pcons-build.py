"""Running commands behind a launcher.

A launcher runs in front of the command an edge would otherwise run:
``ccache`` before the compiler, ``time`` before anything worth measuring.
See the Command Launchers section of the user guide.

Two stacked launchers wrap every C compile here, and a third belongs to a
single command. Both stand-ins ship with the example so it runs anywhere;
the real thing needs only a program name. For a compiler cache there is a
shortcut that finds whichever is installed::

    env.use_compiler_cache()
