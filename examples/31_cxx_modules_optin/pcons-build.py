"""Build script for a target whose module units live in `.cpp` files.

By default pcons triggers C++ module scanning only when a target has at
least one source whose extension is recognized as a module-interface unit
(`.cppm`, `.ixx`, `.cxxm`, `.c++m`). Real-world projects that put their
primary interface in `.cpp`/`.cc` (e.g. fmtlib's `src/fmt.cc`,
mp-units's `mp-units.cpp`) need an explicit opt-in:

    env.cxx.modules = True

This example exercises that opt-in. Without the flag, pcons would compile
both files as ordinary C++ and the build would fail because main.cpp
imports a module that was never registered.
