"""Content-discovered build order, over sources this build generates itself.

Scenes reference other scenes by name. Packing a scene embeds a digest of every
pack it references, so a referenced pack has to be built first -- but *which*
pack that is, is a fact about file content, and nothing in this script says it.
A `Scanner` settles it at build time. No compiler is involved anywhere here.

1. **Only the scanner reads a `ref` line.** `tools/scan_scene.py` reports what
   each pack provides and requires; pcons collates those reports into a ninja
   dyndep file, and the ordering shows up in the build graph. Nothing below
   encodes "level2 after level1" -- move a `ref` line to another scene and the
   build order follows it, with no edit to this script.

2. **Discovered facts reach the command line, too.** `edge_args` has collate
   write each pack edge a `.refs` file listing the packs that edge must read,
   and appends `$SCENE_REFS` to its command. The path is fixed at configure
   time; only the content is decided at build time. So `tools/pack_scene.py`
   never parses a scene for refs -- it is told.

3. **Target dependencies carry the *exports*, not the order.** A scope resolves
   a required name against the scopes it depends on, so `pack_level2` needs
   `add_dependency(pack_level1)` to see the name "level1" at all. That
   dependency says where to look; the scene's content decides what is used and
   in which order.

4. **Generated sources need no phases.** Two generations of them here: the
   build assembles `genscene1.py` from checked-in fragments, runs it to get a
   scanned scene *and* a fragment of the next generator, assembles
   `genscene2.py` from that, and runs it for another scanned scene. A scan edge
   takes a generated scene as an input like any other, so its producer's
   ordering comes from the node graph -- no staging, no reconfigure, no
   existence checks. (Scanning before the generator has run is what deadlocks
   a whole-project scan pass; see issue #105 for the C++ modules version.)
