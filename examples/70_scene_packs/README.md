# Content-discovered build order, over sources the build generates

Three scene packs, no compiler. A `.scene` file names what it provides and
what it references; compiling one into a `.pack` embeds a digest of every pack
it references, so a referenced pack has to be built first. Which pack that is
lives in the scene text, and nothing in `pcons-build.py` says it.

```python
scene_refs = Scanner(
    "scene-refs",
    source_suffixes=[".scene"],
    scan_command=[python, "$SRCDIR/tools/scan_scene.py", NodeVar("PACK"),
                  "$SOURCES", "$TARGET"],
    scan_deps=["tools/scan_scene.py"],
    scan_vars=pack_of_edge,
    on_unresolved="error",
    edge_args=EdgeArgsSpec(suffix=".refs", var="SCENE_REFS", token="$SCENE_REFS",
                           format=ArgsFormat(line="{name} {path}"),
                           include="requires"),
)
scene_refs.attach(pack_common, pack_level1, pack_level2)
```

**Only the scanner reads a `ref` line.** `tools/scan_scene.py` reports each
pack's provides and requires as JSON; pcons collates those into a ninja dyndep
file. The build statement for `packs/level2.pack` has no ordering in it at all:

```
build packs/level2.pack: command_cmdline_32e8d26d gen/generated2.scene | ...
```

and the ordering arrives at build time, from what the scenes said:

```
# scan/scene-refs/scene_packs.pack_level2.dyndep
build packs/level2.pack: dyndep | packs/level1.pack
```

**The discovered facts reach the command line too.** `edge_args` has collate
write each pack edge a `.refs` file — `common packs/common.pack` — and appends
`$SCENE_REFS` to that edge's command. The path is fixed at configure time, the
content decided at build time, so `tools/pack_scene.py` is *told* which packs
to read rather than parsing a scene for refs.

**Target dependencies carry the exports, not the order.** A scope resolves a
required name only against the scopes it depends on, so `pack_level2` needs
`add_dependency(pack_level1)` to see the name `level1` at all. The dependency
says where to look; the scene content decides what gets used, and when.

## Generated sources, twice over

The scanned sources don't all exist when the build starts:

```
src/gen_head.pyfrag + src/gen1_payload.pyfrag  ->  bin/genscene1.py
        run it  ->  gen/generated1.scene   (packed into level1)
                +   gen/gen2_payload.pyfrag (part of the next generator)
src/gen_head.pyfrag + gen/gen2_payload.pyfrag  ->  bin/genscene2.py
        run it  ->  gen/generated2.scene   (packed into level2)
```

A scan edge takes a generated scene as an input like any other, so its
producer's ordering comes from the node graph. There are no phase
declarations, no staging, no reconfigure, and no existence checks anywhere in
the build script — pcons runs once and ninja builds it all:

```
$ pcons
[1/13] SCAN[scene-refs] packs/common.pack.scaninfo.json
[2/13] COLLATE[scene-refs] scan/scene-refs/scene_packs.pack_common.dyndep
[3/13] COMMAND packs/common.pack
[4/13] COMMAND bin/genscene1.py
[5/13] COMMAND gen/generated1.scene gen/gen2_payload.pyfrag
[6/13] SCAN[scene-refs] packs/level1.pack.scaninfo.json
...
[13/13] COMMAND packs/level2.pack
```

A scanner that scanned the whole project in one pass could not: the scan of
`generated2.scene` would have to run before the generator that writes it,
which the generator's own scan would have to precede. (Issue #105 is the C++
modules version of the same deadlock.) Here each scan is just another edge, so
there is nothing to break.

## Two details worth copying

**A pack serves every scene inside it.** `scan_vars` gives each scan edge the
pack it is scanning for, and the scan info gives every name that pack's path.
The alternative, `provide_template`, suits a scanner whose every logical name
gets an artifact of its own — a C++ module's BMI — but here several names
share one file, and a template would promise artifacts that never get built.

**`write_if_different=True` on the generator steps.** Editing a fragment to
the same text reassembles `bin/genscene1.py` and stops: identical output, so
nothing downstream re-runs and no pack is rebuilt.
